A program that takes a MIDI roll, and pushes the melody to be more consonant or dissonant depending on user input

All files must be in the same folder.

The only one required to be opened is the "main" file.

The user choses a consonance level using the slider on the bottom of the screen. They then click a melody on the bottom right, the corresponding number next to it, and the closest number to that at the top of the screen.

They then press the active toggle, and the program will run. The melody can be listened to at any point by using the toggle on the bottom of the screen.
